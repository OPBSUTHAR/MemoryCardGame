## Setup Instructions
### Launch Your Mission
- **Clone or Download**: Retrieve the repository or download the `index.html` file containing the game.
- **Host the File**: Open `index.html` in a web browser, or use a local server (e.g., Live Server in VS Code) or hosting service.
- **Ensure Connectivity**: An internet connection is required to load external resources (Google Fonts, Font Awesome).

### Begin Gameplay
- Open the game in a modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Select your desired difficulty from the dropdown menu.
- Click "New Game" to initiate or restart your cosmic adventure.
- Flip cards to find matches and explore the "How to Play" modal for detailed guidance.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- If external resources fail to load (e.g., due to no internet), check your connection or consider hosting local copies of fonts and icons.

## How to Play
### Objective
Match pairs of cards to accumulate points. The player with the most matches triumphs, or it’s a tie if scores are equal.

### Gameplay Rules
- Players alternate flipping two cards per turn.
- A match earns a point and an extra turn; a mismatch flips cards back, passing the turn.

### Winning the Game
The mission concludes when all pairs are matched. The highest scorer claims victory, or share the glory in a tie.

## File Structure

## Known Limitations

- **Performance on Large Grids**: Expert (10×10) mode may lag on low-end devices due to card count and animations.

## Future Enhancements

- **Single-Player Mode**: Introduce AI opponents or time-based challenges.
